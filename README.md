# Project analysis: Information architecture

Information architecture in this web page CV is designed to help a busy recruiter scan quickly without losing context. The arrangement of the elements ensures that the most important information is always visible, while additional details are organized clearly and hierarchically.

The site is divided into two main columns. In the left sidebar, the most personal data is grouped: the photo, contact information, technical skills, and soft skills. This part works like the candidate’s “business card” where the recruiter can immediately see who the candidate is and what they can do.

In the central and right area, the more extensive content is developed:

- Professional Profile, which briefly introduces the candidate’s background and goals.

- Work Experience, with a detailed description of the positions held and responsibilities.

- Education, where the studies completed and the current degree are listed.

- Languages, showing the level of proficiency using graphic bars.

Each section is separated with striking titles, representative icons, and well-defined blocks to make reading easier.

This organization aims to ensure the user does not get lost in the information, that everything has a natural flow, and that reading is comfortable. The combination of clear sections, visual labels, and icons helps maintain an ordered and coherent structure, making the information easy to find and remember.

# Project analysis: Visual design

The visual design aims to convey a modern, clean, and professional image, reflecting the personality of a computer engineering student interested in technology. The idea was to create a serious look, but not boring, combining colors, typography, and structure so the result is elegant and easy to read.

The color palette is based on a dark blue (#00044C) as the main color, which gives a sense of professionalism and trust. It is combined with a light lilac (#D2D2F9), which adds contrast and a more pleasant visual touch. The white background keeps the page clean and improves text readability. Complementary colors are also used, such as green (#048500) for completed studies and orange (#E37D00) for studies in progress, which helps visually differentiate academic progress.

The chosen typeface is Arial because it is simple, readable, and common in digital environments. The text uses different sizes depending on the importance of the information, which helps mark hierarchies.

The design uses two columns, rounded corners, and enough spacing between elements so the content does not look crowded. Icons and progress bars not only make the CV more visual but also help understand the information at a glance.

In conclusion, the design aims to reflect a professional, orderly, and technology-oriented image, aligned with the candidate’s profile.
